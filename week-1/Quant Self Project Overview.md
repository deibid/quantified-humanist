## Assignment `#1.2`: Self Tracking Projects Review


 
Quant Self projects that I find inspiring and interesting

---

### The Everyday Calendar

This project created by Simone Giertz proposes a very interesting idea: 

***hang a dashboard with 365 buttons that you can click on to mark the completion of a task on any given day.***

It's meant to help us reinforce the discipline that is required to create habits. It was pitched on Kickstarter and passed its original backing goal by almost 1700%.
