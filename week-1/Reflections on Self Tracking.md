## Assignment `#1.3`: Reflections on self-tracking

#### My history with self tracking
I never really thought about the term Self Tracking on Quantified Self/Humanist.

I realized by enrolling in this class that I have been doing this a long time. I think the first time I quantified myself in any way was when I was around 11 years old. One day I sat down and made a grid with all the different abilities and responsibilities I had. I used my brand-new set of colored pencils to give each one a ranking and felt really proud of that.


My parents use to give me and my brothers stars on a whiteboard for good behavior. Once any of us got to 5, we got a price. Maybe that's what planted the first seed in my self-tracking practices..

Nowadays, I like trying different apps to track habits, sleep, and steps taken in any given day.

#### What comes next

I'm very interested in making something that allows me to track and visualize things in my life. I'm currently drafting a strategy to track how I spend my time. 

I really think that for something to be a successful tracking strategy it has to not distract you in the first place. 

_**Some ideas come to mind**_
* Chrome extension that you can activate with a hotkey and talk to it?
* Physical box with a button that you press and say the thing that just distracted you? It would parse everything and create a report at the end of the day/week/month/year for you to visualize.


There are a lot possibilities..
