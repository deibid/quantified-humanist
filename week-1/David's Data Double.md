#### Facebook (~250 MB)


Requested my data in both HTMl and JSON format. HTML will let me to visualize it faster with the pre-made Facebook format and
will allow me to do further analize it and visualize it in new ways.

I'm honestly impressed with the thoroughness of the data. Facebook is the first social platform I ever joined. I don't really use it anymore
but it's interesting to see how far back some of my likes, comments and chats go.

I switched schools on 8th grade and the search history reflects that. Pretty amazing and scaring at the same time.


#### Spotify

50% of my awake time is spent listening to music. I requested Spotify my info but haven't heard anything back.

#### WhatsApp (188 KB)

WhatsApp is my main messaging platform. I use it all the time and have been using it for almost 10 years. The data is a bit dissapointing,
it show only my app settings, my profile picture, the groups I'm a part of and my device information.

#### Instagram (8.1 MB)

Im more of a consumer than a creator of content and this data sump really shows it. Interesting to see that searches only go back to early 2018.


#### Google (570 MB)

I use Google's services the most.

* YouTube

Only 2 comments in my +10 years of using the platform

* Maps

Most files are in JSON. Will deffinetly look deeper into them
