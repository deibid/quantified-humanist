## Assignment `#1.2`: Self Tracking Projects Review


 
Quant Self projects that I find inspiring and interesting

---

### The Everyday Calendar

This project created by Simone Giertz proposes a very interesting idea: 

***hang a dashboard with 365 buttons that you can click on to mark the completion of a task on any given day.***

It's meant to help us reinforce the discipline that is required to create habits. It was pitched on Kickstarter and passed its original backing goal by almost 1700%.

The video show a very endearing story. I personally feel that while the design is beautiful, placing it in your bedroom might be a bad idea due to the bright light it produces, and you can only track 1 habit at a time. 

Paring this with an app that allowed me to change the habit I'm tracking and having the Calendar show that would be a very cool thing.

### Muse

Headband for tracking brainwaves during your meditation practice.
Muse intends to uncover some of the hidden processes and physiological benefits obtained by meditation.

It's a beautifully designed product in my opinion. The headband is accompanied by an app that gives you diverse meditation exercises and connects you to a like-minded community.

I like this product a lot because it successfully uncovers many mysteries about the activity in our brains, and is provides a strong step forwards into a more healthy self.

### SnoreLab

SnoreLab is an app for both iOS and Android that lets users record their snoring throughout any night's sleep.

I personally have used it close to 10 times in different times of my life. This past winter break I got sick from an ugly flu and the doctor asked me to track my snoring. The results are both funny and terrifying.

The free version is good but very limited. However, you can really see the effort and quality of work behind this app.
